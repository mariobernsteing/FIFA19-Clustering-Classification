## Background
This project is a statistical analysis of the players of FIFA 19's game, using the real dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/) which contains more than 18k fifa players with around 90 attributes. I used Spark and Python to be able to navigate into the dataset and provide interesting insights. Moreover, I made use of Spark packages in order to identify patterns to cluster the players and then classified them into a specific position. Let's check it out!
